1. [Official Repo](https://github.com/foundry-rs)
2. [Official Manual](https://github.com/foundry-rs/book) - [Readable](https://book.getfoundry.sh) - It is highly recommended to go through the manual before trying to learn it from external sources. In my experience, this will enable you to remember the official reference resources

# üçå Repo Purpose 

I am of the opinion that eventually SkidsDAO should have a great wiki and/or a [Rust mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) of learning resources in general. FOSS of course. Eventually, as I progress with acquiring evidence of actual ability I may look into this area under this banner or something else. This matter is under constant investigation.


# üçå Issue Description 

1. This issue is being made after observing the need to consolidate some learning resources for [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) - Which is an Ethereum Development Toolkit written in Rust. Which makes it very fast for compiling, testing & decoding. 
4. This issue will be list of strictly video learning resources which have been extracted from a variety of sources 
5. The following urls are not exhaustive in anyway, note there are new resources popping up all the time
6. It is highly recommended to follow [gakonst](https://twitter.com/gakonst) who is the founder of `Foundry` , this toolset is being updated constantly.
